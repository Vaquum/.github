# The Vaquum Ecosystem

Vaquum is a comprehensive Bitcoin product ecosystem designed to professionalize and optimize the entire quantitative trading lifecycle—for solo quants, specialist Bitcoin funds, and institutional Bitcoin teams.

# The Core Philosophy

Vaquum is defined by four distinct characteristics:

- Bitcoin-Only: Purpose-built for Bitcoin, stripping away the "crypto-casino" noise and rejecting the outdated assumptions of traditional finance.

- Parametric: Everything is a parameter. It replaces rigid abstractions and guesswork with granular control, allowing you to explore the full topology of market potential.

- Closed-Loop: Full-system feedback awareness. Every component can receive downstream metrics and parameter updates, so the system evolves coherently—and the strategy deployed is always the strategy tested.

- Fully Modular: Each component functions as a powerful standalone tool or integrates seamlessly to form a unified stack.

**Everything available on permissive open source license. Forever.**

# The Architecture

Vaquum consists of five interoperable modules:

## Origo: The Data Layer
A unified data API serving as the intake engine. It coalesces multi-exchange spot, futures, and order book data, Bitcoin mempool analytics, social sentiment streams, and global liquidity metrics into a single, cohesive data graph.

*Coming in early 2026*

## Limen: The Model Engine
An advanced parameter sweep and research environment featuring a curated suite of 15+ ML architectures for Bitcoin modeling. It offers extreme convenience for bringing your own models and a sophisticated system for decoder cohort building and management.

## Nexus: The Command Center
The operational core for managing trading logic. Nexus orchestrates the decision-making process, bridging the gap between theoretical models and live operations—while exposing feedback hooks for downstream execution and performance signals to flow back upstream.

*Coming later in 2026*

## Praxis: The Execution System
A rigorous and secure trade execution environment with a built-in double-entry bookkeeping system. It ensures precise book and account management, aligning execution with financial reality.

*Coming in early 2026*

## Veritas: The Source of Truth
The oversight layer for end-to-end auditability across Origo, Limen, Nexus, and Praxis. It provides an immutable, system-wide record and built-in auditor capabilities to ensure operating integrity, accountability, and complete transparency.

*Coming in 2027*
